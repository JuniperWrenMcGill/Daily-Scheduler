## Features

- **Task Management:** Current Day Display: The daily planner displays the current day at the top of the calendar.

- **Time Blocking:**  The planner presents timeblocks for standard business hours from 9 am to 5 pm.
Implementation: Generate and render timeblocks within the specified time range on the planner.


- **Color-Coded:**  Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
Implementation: Apply different styles (colors) to timeblocks dynamically based on the current time.


- **Event Entry in Timeblocks:**  Users can click into a timeblock to enter an event for that specific hour.


- **Save Event to Local Storage:**  Users can save entered events by clicking the save button for a specific timeblock.
Implementation: Use local storage to store and retrieve event data associated with each timeblock.


- **Persistent Event Storage:**  Saved events persist even after refreshing the page.
Implementation: Ensure that saved event data is retrieved from local storage and displayed when the page is refreshed.
